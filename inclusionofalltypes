recently when reading some articles, I realize something that the Calvinist restricting "all people" to "all types of people".
If it is true that God draws, or is the propitiation of "all types" (all without distinction), wouldn't 'non-elect' be a type?
Or is that type excluded by the Calvinist because it destroys their hermeneutic?
I have to agree that, Calvinists got some special favor and special enlightenment from God.
Because Normal Christians can not understand the scriptures, the way they understand.
