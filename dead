Imagine visiting your local cemetery and discovering they hired a person to put blind folds and ear plugs on the corpses lest they respond willingly to the sights and sounds around the graveyard. Would this strike you as peculiar?
If you question the in charge of that cemetery, saying "sir, why are you putting blind folds and ear plugs on dead people"
Imagine if you get a reply like "well, that is to make sure these dead people won't respond to any sights and sounds"
Tell me honestly, how would you react. 
On top of it...if the discussion goes further and that in charge says
 "you don't understand how cemetery works" 
Now tell me honestly, what would be your reply. 
Same thing is happening around us also. There are some teachings and they say that, humans are dead in state and can not respond to word of God, they can never understand even if someone clearly explaining about Jesus Christ and his birth, his life style and his death and resurrection and explaining about Israel country...and much more.
They say it does not matter, how much you share the good news ...humans are dead.
Now here are my objections for that.
1. Why Satan blinds the minds of unbelievers when they CAN NOT understand or grasp anything....?
I thought humans are already deprived and dead .
whats the necessity to blind people 
See what John Piper says here:
https://www.desiringgod.org/.../satans-ten-strategies...
John Piper himself says , Satan is blinding the minds of UNBELIEVERS.
2. Satan plucks the word of God out of people’s hearts and chokes faith.
Now, If you question anything ....the typical and standard reply we will get as below:
“See Arun , you don’t understand Calvinism”
#youDontUnderstandCalvinism
#youDontGetIt
