Sovereign means God is the supreme ruler. He has set rules and boundaries and has determined blessings for obedience and consequences for disobedience. He interacts with His creation. Prayer, repentance, humbling ourselves can all have an impact and Scripture shows that God has changed His mind when His people pray and humble themselves.
2 Chronicles 7:14 CSB â€” and my people, who bear my name, humble themselves, pray and seek my face, and turn from their evil ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land."
