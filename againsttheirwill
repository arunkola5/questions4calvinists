If God makes them want to, then do they truly want to? 
Sounds like bait and switch to me. 
Bait, God doesn't bring elect against their will. 
Switch, God just makes them willing. SO, they want to.

Reformed theology does not teach that God brings the elect "kicking and screming, against their wills", into his kingdom.
It teaches that God so works in the hearts of the elect as to make them willing and please to come to Christ. 

They come to Christ because they want to. 
They want to because God has created in their hearts a desire for Christ.
